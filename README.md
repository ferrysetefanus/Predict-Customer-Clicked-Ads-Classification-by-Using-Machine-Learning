# Predict-Customer-Clicked-Ads-Classification-by-Using-Machine-Learning
In this mini project, I created a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will click on a given ad or not, the algorithm used to build this model is XGBoost with a recall score of 98%. The 4 most influential features in this machine learning model are daily internet usage, time spent daily in location, regional income, and age. By utilizing machine learning, we can focus our ads on customers who are predicted to click on our ads. By knowing which customers will click, we can reduce the cost of ad serving. Through business simulation, it was found that there was a 30.67% increase in revenue (from $1500 to $1960) by using machine learning to target ads to customers who would specifically click on the ads.
